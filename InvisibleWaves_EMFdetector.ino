INVISIBLE WAVES

This is the code for simple hand held EMF detectors.
The closer you bring the antenna to an EMF source, the longer 

CONNECTIONS:
- connect beeper (+) to D3
- connect beeper (-) to GND
- connect antenna to A5
- connect 3 - 6 Mega ohm resistor between A5 and GND

ANTENNA:
You can experiment with the antenna dimensions and shape. 
It can be (for example) a simple wire or a plate of aluminium foil.
